# Toy scraping pages

This folder is for a scraping assignment for my students.

The idea is to build a scraper that will iteratively follow links on all the
pages, while using a cache to avoid needlessly requesting pages multiple times.

There are 676 html pages. Depending on how the randomly assigned links work
out, and depending on which page is used as the start page, a crawler may or
may not be able to find all of them.
